.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Start a program in a pseudo terminal and:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
redirect its input from stdin, and output to stdout
.IP \(bu 2
log everything in a log file named \fIptylog\fP by default
.IP \(bu 2
inject keystrokes and other events according to directives given in
a file
.UNINDENT

The PTY part of this programm is originally by Rachid Koucha
enhanced by Lars Brinhoff and Pierre Gentile for use in this program.

.SH COMMANDS
.sp
Each character present in \fIcommand_file\fP will be injected into the
keyboard buffer of \fIprogram_to_launch\fP\&.
.sp
Legal C special characters like \fB\et\fP and \fB\eb\fP are understood.
.sp
Some extra special sequences are also understood:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\es[n]\fP
sets an interval of \fBn\fP ms between each of the next characters
to inject.
.sp
When not set or set to a value less than 1/20s, the interval is 1/20s.
.TP
.B \fB\eS[n]\fP
sleeps once for \fBn\fP ms.
.TP
.B \fB\eu[h]\fP
injects a sequence of up to 4 hexadecimal numbers (UTF\-8).
.TP
.B \fB\eW[XxY]\fP
resizes the slave\(aqs terminal to \fBX\fP columns and \fBY\fP lines.
.TP
.B \fB\ec[color sequence]\fP
injects color codes, the trailing \fBm\fP is automatically added.
(Ex: \fB33;1\fP injects the sequence \fB\ee[33;1m\fP which means yellow).
Use \fBman console_codes\fP for details.
.TP
.B \fB\eR[file]\fP
inserts the directives found in the file \fBfile\fP from now. At end
of file, switch back to the previous included file or the default
command file.
.TP
.B \fB\eCc\fP
injects the character \fBCTRL\-c\fP where \fBc\fP is any character.
The result is the same whether the character is lowercase or
uppercase.
.TP
.B \fB\eMc\fP
injects the character \fBc\fP preceded by an escape (0x1b).
This sequence is generated when the ALT key is used.
